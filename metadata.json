{"author":"Mask","description":"Help Mask Network to provide decentralized and privacy-preserving access to major social networks. You can use your user side account to read public information from Twitter, providing Mask users with a way to view content on the platform. Note: Your login credentials are only used to establish a session, and will never leave your device. Rewards are calculated based on the amount of time your node remains online. The longer you stay online, the greater the reward you will receive. The base bounty per round is 3000 KOII, which will be divided among users who have made submissions in the last round. It's a good idea to use a secondary Twitter account for this project to maintain the smooth functioning of your main account.","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/somali0128/mask-task","createdAt":1721332418703,"migrationDescription":"Audit Function updated","imageUrl":"https://bafybeibwhuknzvnhwu3vazoke67atarqaedhtv235t3qgzny6i54qkzoe4.ipfs.w3s.link/task-mask.png","requirementsTags":[{"type":"TASK_VARIABLE","value":"TWITTER_USERNAME","description":"The username of your volunteer Twitter account.
